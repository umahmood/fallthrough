If you SSH into your Raspberry Pi and have noticed a lag when typing characters into the terminal. Then the following fix may get rid of the lag (it worked for me!).

Log into your Raspberry Pi and type:
```
$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
At the bottom of the config file add:
```
UseDns no
```
Save the file, then restart sshd:
```
$ service ssh restart
```
Or better, reboot your Raspberry Pi:
```
$ sudo reboot
```
SSH'ing into your Raspberry Pi should no longer be slow after these steps. ðŸ¤ž

Fin.
