Borg backup has a `--exclude-if-present` flag, which allows you to ignore a directory from being backed up, If it contains a certain 'tag' file. 

So given the following directory structure, which we want to back up:
```
+ MyFiles
	+ dirA
		- file_one.pdf
		- file_two.pdf
	+ dirB
		- spreadsheet.xsl
		- image.png
```
If we want to ignore `dirB` from being backed up by borg, we have to create a tag file in that directory:
```
$ cd dirB
$ touch borg-ignore-dir
```
**Note:** the tag file does not have to be named `borg-ignore-dir`. You can name it however you like. 

Now we can run borg backup as follows:
```
$ borg create --exclude-if-present borg-ignore-dir ~/borgs/MyFiles::BackupName MyFiles/
```
Only `dirA` will be backed up.
